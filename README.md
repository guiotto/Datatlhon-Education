# Datatlhon-Education
This Datathlon was hosted by the Brazil's Education Ministery - https://www.desafiodedados.com.br/. It was focused on visualization about some aspect of the educational situation with use of Tabeau. However, the data mining/wrangling could be done by any software.

I have experience with socieconomic data from several sorts. However, dealing with more than 50 millions observations (with lots of columns) in R was a novelty for me. I've had to lear how do use "ffbase" package to increase productivity in the analysis and to get the data workable on my computer.

It was used the Scholar Census and Educational Performance, both are official Brazilian datasets.

The .R are the scripts generated, in R, to elaborate the final dataset. 
The visualizations can be seen at:
